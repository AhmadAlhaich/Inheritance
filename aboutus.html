                    <h2> The Three Main Rules:</h2>

                    <div class="line"></div>

                    <div class="articleBody clear">

<p>Verse I Regarding (sons, daughters, father and mother):
Allah commands you regarding your children: the share of the male will be twice that of the female.1 If you leave only two ˹or more˺ females, their share is two-thirds of the estate. But if there is only one female, her share will be one-half. Each parent is entitled to one-sixth if you leave offspring.2 But if you are childless and your parents are the only heirs, then your mother will receive one-third.3 But if you leave siblings, then your mother will receive one-sixth4—after the fulfilment of bequests and debts.5 ˹Be fair to˺ your parents and children, as you do not ˹fully˺ know who is more beneficial to you.6 ˹This is˺ an obligation from Allah. Surely Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.<p>



<p>Verse II Regarding (wives, husband, Step-Siblings-Mother-Side):
You will inherit half of what your wives leave if they are childless. But if they have children, then ˹your share is˺ one-fourth of the estate—after the fulfilment of bequests and debts. And your wives will inherit one-fourth of what you leave if you are childless. But if you have children, then your wives will receive one-eighth of your estate—after the fulfilment of bequests and debts. And if a man or a woman leaves neither parents nor children but only a brother or a sister ˹from their mother’s side˺, they will each inherit one-sixth, but if they are more than one, they ˹all˺ will share one-third of the estate1—after the fulfilment of bequests and debts without harm ˹to the heirs˺.2 ˹This is˺ a commandment from Allah. And Allah is All-Knowing, Most Forbearing.<p>



<p>Verse III Regarding (brothers and sisters):
They ask you ˹for a ruling, O Prophet˺. Say, “Allah gives you a ruling regarding those who die without children or parents.” If a man dies childless and leaves behind a sister, she will inherit one-half of his estate, whereas her brother will inherit all of her estate if she dies childless. If this person leaves behind two sisters, they together will inherit two-thirds of the estate. But if the deceased leaves male and female siblings, a male’s share will be equal to that of two females. Allah makes ˹this˺ clear to you so you do not go astray. And Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all things.1</p>

Al-Hadith Al-Sharif:
Follow the obligatory duties with their people, so as long as the statutes are kept, the first male is the first

The most trusted and reliable reference was the book "The Science Of Inheritance In Its Quranic Relief Approach" By The Scientest Prof. Abd-Alhadi Al-bani. The book was published in early 1990s and teached to the students in the Arabic countries especially in Syria And Lebanon. The easy approach that was made by the Proffessor AL-bani was the thing that made it clear and very reliable to be teached and learned with few lessons only. Other References were books like "Inheritance between questioner and respondent" by Sheikh Musa bin Abboud Al-Hamada. And "Al-Wafi in explaining the Personal Status Law" By Prof. Dr. Mohamed Ahmed Hassan Al-Qudah
